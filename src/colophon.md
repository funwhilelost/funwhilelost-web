## Colophon

This website is built on [11ty](https://11ty.dev), compiled on Github, then uploaded to [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com) static hosting.

I keep most of my ideas in Notion, using a Zettelkasten system, and then transcribe the good bits to the site.

I'm hoping to automate some of my other silos into this indieweb site using [PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) - publish elsewhere, syndicate on own site.  I'm setting up n8n and other tools to make this happen.
