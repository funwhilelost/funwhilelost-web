# Snackcountry

My philosophy on getting outdoors in the winter is that you should maximize fun and minimize
hassles.  This opens the door for a mindful, moving meditative practice in the snow.

Groomed trails can be fun and sporty but I'm maximizing on "smiles per mile".  Prepared with
[good maps](/mapping) and an open mind I like to explore new destinations whenever I go out.

## Gear

- [Good Maps](/mapping)
- Wide, go anywhere XC Skis (mine are Madshus Panorama M72s with Alpina Alaska NNNBC Boots)
